# Linux Device Driver Development Practice using Raspberry Pi 4B

This repository contains practice exercises for developing Linux device drivers using the Raspberry Pi 4B.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience in developing Linux device drivers on the Raspberry Pi 4B. This includes setting up the development environment, writing simple drivers, and testing them on the Raspberry Pi.

## Prerequisites

1. **Raspberry Pi 4B**: Ensure you have an SD card with Raspbian OS installed.
2. **Computer**: You will need a computer to connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH or directly.
3. **Internet Connection**: Required for installing and updating packages.

## Setting Up the Environment

1. **Update and Upgrade Your System**

    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

2. **Install Necessary Packages**

    ```sh
    sudo apt install raspberrypi-kernel-headers build-essential
    ```

3. **Clone This Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linux-device-driver-practice.git
    cd linux-device-driver-practice
    ```
